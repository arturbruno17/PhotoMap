# ðŸ“œ About

This application allows users to relate their photos with their respective locations on the map, providing an intuitive and interactive way to visualize memories tied to geographic coordinates.

### Features

**Location Search with Autocomplete**: Easily search for places with autocomplete suggestions. Upon selecting a suggestion, the map navigates to the desired location, similar to Google Maps.

**Current Location Navigation**: A button that takes the user directly to their current location on the map.

**Photo Markers**: Long-pressing on the map adds a marker with a button displaying a "+" symbol. Clicking this button opens a form containing the marker's latitude and longitude, along with an option to upload a photo associated with that location. Once submitted, the marker becomes fixed on the map.

**Photo Display**: Clicking on the marker reveals the associated photo.

**Marker Deletion**: The photo display screen includes an option to delete the marker, which removes both the photo from the app's internal storage and its reference in the database.

This app provides a seamless way to map memories with visual context, combining geolocation with photo management.
